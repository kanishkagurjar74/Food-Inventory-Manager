PROJECT OVERVIEW: Food Inventory Manager

Food Inventory Manager is a mobile application developed using React Native that helps users manage their food items. The app allows users to perform the following actions:

Add New Food Items: Users can add new food items to the inventory by providing the name of the food item.
Delete Existing Food Items: Users can delete food items from the inventory if they are no longer needed.
Update Availability Status: Users can mark food items as unavailable (inactive) when they are out of stock and reactivate them when they become available again.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
The project consists of the following main components:

App.js: The entry point of the application. It sets up the navigation between different screens using React Navigation.
Screens:
FoodListScreen.js: Displays the list of food items and provides options to delete items or toggle their availability status.
AddFoodItemScreen.js: Provides a form to add new food items to the inventory.
EditFoodItemScreen.js: (Optional) Provides functionality to edit existing food items.


WORKING - 
FoodListScreen:

Displays a list of food items using a FlatList component.
Each item in the list shows the name of the food item and its availability status.
Includes buttons to delete the food item or toggle its availability status.
A button at the bottom navigates to the AddFoodItemScreen.
AddFoodItemScreen:

Contains a text input field for the user to enter the name of the new food item.
Includes a button to add the food item to the inventory.
On submission, the new food item is added to the list, and the user is navigated back to the FoodListScreen.
State Management:

Uses React's useState hook to manage the list of food items and their states.
State updates (adding, deleting, toggling availability) are handled within the respective screens and passed down as props or through navigation parameters.


EXAMPLE USAGE -
Launching the App:

The user opens the app and is presented with a list of food items on the FoodListScreen.
Adding a Food Item:

The user clicks the "Add Food Item" button, navigates to the AddFoodItemScreen, enters the food item name, and clicks "Add Food Item".
The app navigates back to the FoodListScreen, and the new item appears in the list.
Managing Food Items:

The user can delete an item by clicking the "Delete" button next to it.
The user can toggle the availability status by clicking the "Mark Unavailable" or "Mark Available" button.
This application provides a simple yet effective way to manage food inventory, helping users keep track of available and unavailable items efficiently.
